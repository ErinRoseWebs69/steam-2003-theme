# Steam 2003 UI Theme
Steam 2003 UI theme for Discord. This is a heavy edit of refact0r's `system24` theme. You can find the original theme here: https://github.com/refact0r/system24

Ensured to add a lot of variables for complete customizability. This repository will also include the `Tahoma` font, which was the font used by Valve for the 2003 UI. This particular one is for Windows, but if I can find installs for other platforms, I'll make sure to include them.

All example customs shown below will be available on the repo in the future.
